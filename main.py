#Students need to use a selection statement and 2 loops in order to complete this activity. 
#Students will receive basic python code and they will piece together the solution. If a student cannot complete this activity they should provide pseudocode of what they imagine the solution to be. 
#--------write your code below ----- #


x=0
stars="**"
#print(stars)

if (x<5):
    for i in range(6):
        print(stars*x)
        x+=1
        
else: 
    for i in range(5):
        print(stars*x)
        x+=1
        
x-=1
print(x)
for i in range(6):
    x-=1
    print(stars*x)
